When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you are collaborating online with a number of people who all are making changes to a project simultaneously

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    It's less faff for one. But also because the changes on GitHub are consistant with the project as a whole where as your personal Fit file may end up out of sync

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Branches are for creating and editing code that's separate from the master code so you can experiment or so you can add it in later. Clones and forks are very similar,
    they just move a git repository to another place so you can work on it there instead. Forks are only for GitHub to GitHub though.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
